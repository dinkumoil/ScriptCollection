# ExplorerContextMenu

This directory contains three Windows Explorer context menu extensions:

* `DeleteADS`  -  Delete NTFS alternate data streams. Can be used to delete the Zone Identifier of files downloaded from the internet to avoid annoying warnings when opening them.
* `OpenConsoleHere`  -  Open a normal console or a console with admin rights in the current directory/the directory of the current file.
* `UpdateExplorerIcons`  -  Force Windows Explorer to reload the data of all desktop and file list icons.

To install the context menu extensions double-click the _install.cmd_ files in the respective directory.

For _DeleteADS_ you will need to download the _Streams.exe_ tool by SysInternals. For _UpdateExplorerIcons_ you will need to download the _WinApiExec.exe_ tool and the _HStart.exe_ tool. See the equally named _*.txt_ files for download links and installation instructions.
