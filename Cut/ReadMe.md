# Cut

This is a small script that provides the functionality of the UNIX `cut` tool with plain Windows Batch script.

The script accepts the following command line switches:

* `/b x`  -  Set the starting line (default: the file's first line)
* `/e x`  -  Set the terminating line (default: the file's last line)
* `/n`    -  Show line numbers (default: off)
