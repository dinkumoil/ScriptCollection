# NppPluginManagement

These scripts allow to manage plugins for Notepad++. It is possible to:

* list and download/install a certain Notepad++ plugin
* list and optionally update a certain Notepad++ plugin which is already installed
* list and update all already installed Notepad++ plugins

Since _CURL_ is used to download plugin packages, it is possible to use a proxy server.

The benefit over using Notepad++'s build in _Plugins Admin_ is that you can always install/update to the plugin versions from the most recent plugins list and that also older versions of Notepad++ prior to v7.6 are supported.
